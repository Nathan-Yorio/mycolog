mycolog lets you keep notes on the different components in your mushroom
cultivation projects. Never lose track of your petri dishes again,
effortlessly review the contents of your storage and easily find genetic
relatives by taking a look at the family tree.

mycolog is free and open software and does not connect to the internet.
Your data stays on your computer alone and there is no risk of losing it
to a discontinued web service.

# Installation
Download mycolog for Windows: [mycolog_0.1.0_Windows_amd64.zip](https://github.com/codesoap/mycolog/releases/download/v0.1.0/mycolog_0.1.0_Windows_amd64.zip)

In order to see family trees, you also need to install Graphviz. You can download it [here](https://graphviz.org/download/#windows).

# Backups
mycolog stores all its data in a single file. On Windows
you'll find it in your user profile folder, usually
`C:\Users\<your-username>\mycolog.sqlite3`. Make sure to create backups
of this file, so that your data is not lost when your computer breaks.
